Another software engineer that does JavaScript development... yes, indeed. But I'm more than that.

I'm **Neil Sweeney**, I hail from the UK in the country-side where that [Frank Turner chap is from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT0676muGrs).

## Work

I've been working "with computers", as my mum puts, it over 10 years now starting as website developer. But current I'm Senior Software Engineer at [Dootrix](https://dootrix.com/) focusing on, but not exclusively, various forms of JavaScript development. Working on the likes from servers to serverless, mobile native to desktop heresy with the odd bit of website development sprinkled in because I'm sellout to WordPress sometimes.

Past professional lives have taken me around the block and around the world working with directory companies, marketing/creative agencies, startups and in pharma. I have my stories to tell, if you want those just watch [Silicon Valley](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)>) and I won't have to repeat myself. But it's a fun and interesting career that I love doing still.

## Life, Snowboarding, Gaming, Whisk(e)y

Suppose you want more about me? Well, I live with my wife, Kerrie, and a [Finnish Lapphund, Enni](https://www.instagram.com/ennithelappy/), named after [the Finnish snowboarder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enni_Rukaj%C3%A4rvi).

That wasn't a random choice, I actually snowboard as well when not trying to shield away from a pandemic. Right now my snowboard serves as a background prop for video calls. I'm cool.

Being this cool, I've managed to embed my socialising into single-player, story heavy, video games that I invest way too much thought process into their meanings. When a game gets meta the extential nightmare is all too real, damm you [Nier: Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nier%3A_Automata).

So what do I do when I want to get over the extentialism? Whisk(e)y! I'm a lover of whisk(e)y in various forms. The whsiky of Scotland and it's highlands, lowlands, also Islay which I can only assume is an island that's only a salt fire. Irish where my pure plastic paddy blood has to like and my punk travelling sensiblities require me to order Jameson from bars around the world. Also all the other places like England, Wales, India, Sweden and... I suppose... American. Woodford Reserve is nice.

## Type 1 Diabetes

For as long as I can remember, I've been a tpye 1 diabetic. I know people dislike people defining them by a condition, as we talk about "the human condition", so my condition is my humanity. So I like to educate people about it when I can... not in the shoving stuff down their throats like my wife does with jelly babies to me when my sugars drop but asking any question being thrown. No question is really off the table with me... unlike the offer of sugar with my coffee.
